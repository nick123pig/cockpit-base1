# cockpit-base1

This package provides a minimal, repackaged ESM build of the [Cockpit base1 library](https://cockpit-project.org/guide/latest/api-base1.html) for convenience. **This is not the recommended way to consume Cockpit**—the Cockpit project suggests using their official distribution and integration methods. However, for simple or experimental use cases, this package can be used as a drop-in ESM module.

### ⚠️ Not Officially Supported
This repackaging is not endorsed or supported by the Cockpit project. Use at your own risk.
